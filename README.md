# Finch Website

This repository is the source to the runfinch project website.

The documentation is written in markdown files, and is hosted by
[mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material
theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## Development

The Finch website can be built and ran locally in containers with Finch, using
the included Compose file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/runfinch/website.git
finch compose up
```

To run the Finch website locally (not within a container) you can also use
python [virtual
environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv) and pip
to install mkdocs.

```bash
# Create a python virtual environment
python3 -m venv .env

# Source the virtual environment
source .env

# Install mkdocs
pip install -r requirements

# Run mkdocs
mkdocs serve
```

You should now be able to browse to mkdocs on http://localhost:8000. To
customize the IP address and port, you can pass the flag `--dev-addr` into the
`mkdocs serve` command.
