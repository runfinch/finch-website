## Installing using the Application Package

For each Finch release, we provider a `.pkg` Application Package. The latest
package can be found on the [Github
Releases](https://github.com/runfinch/finch/releases), with a separate package
available for each architecture (Apple Silicon and Intel).

1. Download the relevant Application Package from the Finch [Github
Releases](https://github.com/runfinch/finch/releases) page. Ensuring you have
   selected the appropriate version and architecture.

2. Once the Application Package has been downloaded, in
   [Finder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201732), you can double click the
   `.pkg` and start the installation. Click continue.
