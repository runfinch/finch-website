# DevContainers for MacOS

## Prerequisites

- Install VSCode and Extension

To install VSCode, refer to instruction at [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your organization administrators.

To install the extension, refer to instructions for the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension.

- Install Finch

To install Finch, refer to [Managing Finch:macOS Installation](https://runfinch.com/docs/managing-finch/macos/installation/).

- Initiate a Finch Virtual Machine (vm)

    ```bash
    finch vm init
    ```

- Modify your `~/.finch/finch.yaml` to add the following configuration option. Refer to [Configuration Reference](https://runfinch.com/docs/configuration-reference/) for more information.

    ```bash
    dockercompat: true
    ```


## Configure VSCode DevContainer Extension Settings

Open the extension settings by navigating within the setting window or using the command palette and typing "Dev Containers: Settings"

- Configure the "Docker Compose Path" to: `<path>/<to>/finch compose`

- Disable "Docker Credential Helper"

- Configure the "Docker Path" to: `<path>/<to>/finch`


## Working with Docker Compose Projects in Dev Containers:

When using `docker compose`, set the `DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION` to a value `> 2.9.0`.
- Set the system environment variable within `.zshrc` and `source .zshrc`

- Use `export DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION=x.x.x` for the current session

> ⚠️ **Note:** Finch only supports dash (`-`) as the project name separator.
> However, Dev Container tooling relies on the separator determined by `docker compose version`.
> If the version is below `2.9.0`, it defaults to using underscores (`_`), causing name mismatches
> and container startup failures. To ensure compatibility, set the `DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION` to `>= 2.9.0`.
