# Installing Finch

> This page is specific to Finch running on macOS. At this time macOS is the
> only supported operating system.

## Prerequisites

To get started with Finch on macOS, the development machine must meet the
following prerequisites.

* macOS versions:
    * 13 Ventura
    * 12 Monterey
    * 11 Big Sur
* Both Intel and Apple Silicon based systems are supported.
* Recommended minimum hardware requirements is at least 2 vCPU and 4 GB memory.
* Administrative privileges are required to install Finch on to the machine.

## Installing Finch with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

To install Finch with a package manager you can leverage the
[homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager.

1. Verify that homebrew is already installed on the system by running the brew
   help command `brew help`. If it is not, navigate to the homebrew
   documentation for [installation
   instructions](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation).

    ```bash
    brew help
    ```

2. Install Finch using the `brew` cli. If prompted, enter your macOS password.

    ```bash
    brew install finch
    ```

3. You can now [verify the installation](#verify-the-finch-installation).

## Installing using the Application Package

For each Finch release, we provider a `.pkg` Application Package. The latest
package can be found on the [Github
Releases](https://github.com/runfinch/finch/releases), with a separate package
available for each architecture (Apple Silicon and Intel).

1. Download the relevant Application Package from the Finch [Github
Releases](https://github.com/runfinch/finch/releases) page. Ensuring you have
   selected the appropriate version and architecture.

2. Once the Application Package has been downloaded, in
   [Finder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201732), you can double click the
   `.pkg` and start the installation. Click continue.

## Verify the Finch Installation

Now that Finch has been successfully installed, you can verify the installation
with the following steps.

1. Once the installation is complete, `finch vm init` is required once to set up
   the underlying system and create the virtual machines. This initial setup
   usually takes about a minute or two, and may once again require your macOS
   password.

    ```bash
    finch vm init
    ```

2. Verify that the installation and the vm initialization have completed by
   running the `hello-finch` container image.

    ```bash
    finch run public.ecr.aws/finch/hello-finch:latest
    ```

    If it has all ran successfully you should now see the output:

    ```bash
