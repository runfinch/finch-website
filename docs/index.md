# Finch

Finch is an open source tool for local container development. Finch aims to help
promote innovative upstream container projects (including
[Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima),
[nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl),
[containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) and
[BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)) by making it easy to install and
use them. Finch provides a simple native client to tie it all together.

Today, Finch is available for developers on macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
and Windows. We plan to make it available to Linux developers soon!

The project is still in its early days, and we have lots of great ideas on where
we want to take Finch. We would love your feedback!
